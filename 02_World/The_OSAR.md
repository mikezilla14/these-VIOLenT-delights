# Setting: The Oakhaven Special Administrative Region (O.S.A.R.)

## 1. Concept: The "Eden" Paradox
The O.S.A.R. is a sovereign "Preservation Zone" tailored for the ultra-wealthy. While the rest of the world is a continuous cyberpunk sprawl, Oakhaven is terraformed to look like a 19th-century pastoral painting.
*   **The Lie:** It looks like nature.
*   **The Truth:** It is the most surveilled and technologically dense region on Earth. The trees are antennas; the rain is pH-balanced; the isolation is manufactured.

## 2. Sector Geography

### **SECTOR 1: THE SPRAWL (The Border)**
*   **Role:** The Service Entrance / The Air-Lock.
*   **Description:** The hyper-urban cyberpunk city that borders the O.S.A.R. This is where the workers, the desperate, and people like Violet live. It is neon, dirty, loud, and vertical.
*   **Key Locations:**
    *   *The Midnight Diner:* Violet's office of necessity.
    *   *Violet's Apartment:* A cramped conapt in a stack-slum.
*   **Visual Hook:** Pink/Cyan neon reflecting on wet asphalt, overcrowding, holographic debt collectors.

### **SECTOR 4: THE GREEN ZONE (The Preserve)**
*   **Role:** The Residential District for "Old Money."
*   **Description:** A dense, dark forest region. Architecture is strictly regulated to Tudor, Gothic Revival, or Brutalist styles. No visible tech is allowed on building exteriors.
*   **Key Locations:**
    *   *The Copper Beeches:* Jephro Rucastle's estate.
*   **The "Copper Beech" Phenomenon:** The trees in this sector are genetically modified with high metal content in the foliage. They act as a natural **Faraday Cage**, blocking all unauthorized signals (Cellular/Data) to ensure total privacy (and imprison victims).
*   **Visual Hook:** Metallic bronze leaves, deep shadows, fog, tungsten (warm) lighting, oppressive silence.

### **SECTOR 9: MARINA BAY (The Coast)**
*   **Role:** The Playground / The Laboratory.
*   **Description:** The coastal edge of the region, extending into international waters. A mix of high-end yacht clubs and industrial research rigs.
*   **Key Locations:**
    *   *The Aethelgard Platform:* A converted oil rig used for "Medical Tourism."
*   **Visual Hook:** Bioluminescent teal water, sterile white chrome, glass walkways, heavy rain, isolation.

## 3. Technology & Law

### The Bio-Integrity Acts
Laws that strictly prohibit "visible" cybernetics within O.S.A.R. limits to maintain the "Natural Aesthetic."
*   **Loophole:** The rich use "Invisible Tech" (Neural Laces, Genetic Tweaks).
*   **The Crime:** The Underworld traffics in "Wetware"—human test subjects used to beta-test these invisible augmentations before they are sold to the elite.

### The "Ghost" Signal
Because Sector 4 blocks standard signals, the Trafficking Network uses a dedicated hardline frequency known as "The Root System"—cables buried deep beneath the trees, often running into the basements of the manors.

## 4. Global Environmental Prompts

### Sector 1 (The City)
> `Cyberpunk slum street, towering skyscrapers blocking the sky, neon signs (pink/cyan) reflecting in puddles, heavy rain, crowded with faceless people, hologram ads, trash piled in alleys, cinematic depth of field, high contrast.`

### Sector 4 (The Forest)
> `Neo-pastoral noir atmosphere, dense forest of trees with metallic copper leaves, winding asphalt road, overcast sky, fog, vintage luxury car, sense of isolation, gothic horror vibe, low light, warm tungsten windows in distance.`
