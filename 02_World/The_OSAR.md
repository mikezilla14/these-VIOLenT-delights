# Setting: The Oakhaven Special Administrative Region (O.S.A.R.)

## Concept: Neo-Pastoral Noir
A "Preservation Zone" for the ultra-wealthy. Looks like a 19th-century painting (lush forests, rain, manors) but is underlaid with high-tech surveillance and hidden bunkers.

## Visual Contrast
*   **Exterior:** Overcast, rainy, green, Gothic Revival architecture.
*   **Interior:** Sterile, neon-lit, claustrophobic glass and steel.

## Global Environment Prompt
> `Neo-pastoral noir atmosphere, overcast sky, rain-slicked surfaces, lush greenery contrasting with brutalist concrete architecture, volumetric fog, moody lighting, cinematic depth of field, octane render, 4k, highly detailed textures.`

## Key Locations
1.  **The Wellness Retreats:** Clinical trafficking fronts.
2.  **The Neo-Manors:** Private auction houses.
3.  **The Mobile Nodes:** Luxury trains/dirigibles.
