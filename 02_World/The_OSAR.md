# Setting: The Oakhaven Special Administrative Region (O.S.A.R.)

## 1. Concept: The "Eden" Paradox
A sovereign "Preservation Zone" tailored for the ultra-wealthy.
*   **The Lie:** It looks like 19th-century nature.
*   **The Truth:** It is the most surveilled and technologically dense region on Earth.

## 2. Sector Geography

### **SECTOR 1: THE SPRAWL (The Border)**
*   **Role:** The Service Entrance. Where Violet lives.
*   **Visual Hook:** Pink/Cyan neon reflecting on wet asphalt, holographic debt collectors.

### **SECTOR 4: THE GREEN ZONE (The Preserve)**
*   **Role:** Old Money District. Location of *The Copper Beeches*.
*   **The "Copper Beech" Phenomenon:** Genetically modified trees with metallic foliage act as a natural **Faraday Cage** to block signals.
*   **Visual Hook:** Metallic bronze leaves, deep shadows, fog, tungsten lighting.

### **SECTOR 9: MARINA BAY (The Coast)**
*   **Role:** The Playground / Laboratory. Location of *The Aethelgard Platform*.
*   **Visual Hook:** Bioluminescent teal water, sterile white chrome, heavy rain.

## 3. The Economic Engine (R&D)
*   **The Demand:** The Corporate Elite want illegal augments.
*   **The Supply:** The Underworld (Rucastles) uses "Disposables" (Runaways) as "Wetware Chassis" to beta-test these augments.
