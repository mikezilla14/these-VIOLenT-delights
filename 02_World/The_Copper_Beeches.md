## The Staff Dynamics & The "Closed Loop"
**The Problem**: High-tech security systems leave digital footprints.
**Jephro's Solution**: "The Human Firewall."
The Rucastle estate is run by the Tollers. They are "Life-Debt" employees—Jephro saved them from prison or debt-slavery, and now owns them.
**The Rules**: No external comms for staff. No leaving the grounds.
**The Contrast**: Beatrix hates this. She wants to fire the Tollers and install automated turrets. This friction is a plot point: Beatrix might help Violet bypass Toller just to prove to her father that his "human security" is flawed.
*   **The Clues (For the Reader)**
**The Keys**: Eudora carries physical iron keys. Why? Because the attic locks aren't digital. This hints that whatever is in there (Alice) needs to be kept off the grid.
**The Whistle**: Silas uses a high-frequency analog whistle for the dog. Violet realizes later she can mimic this frequency using a hacked phone speaker.
**The Food**: Violet sees Eudora taking a tray of food upstairs. It contains "soft food" (gruel/mash).
**Violet's Deduction**: "Jephro eats steak. Clara eats salads. Beatrix doesn't eat. Who is the soft food for?" (Answer: Alice, who has a jaw infection/neural lace rejection).
