# Arc 01 Cast: The Rucastle Family

## The Family Dynamic: "Predator or Prey"
The Rucastles are not cartoon villains. They are a family unit warped by the belief that the world is a slaughterhouse, and they refuse to be the cattle.

## Clara Rucastle (The Mother)
*   **Role:** The Pragmatist / The Tiger Mother.
*   **Psychology:** She has seen the cruelty of the world (poverty, the corporate crush). She decided long ago that moral purity is a luxury she cannot afford.
*   **Motivation:** She loves her children absolutely. She enables Jephro’s "business" not because she enjoys it, but because it buys safety for her bloodline. Clara comes from a poor family and had to do everything she could to claw her way out of poverty. Jephro was her salvation from both poverty and the amoral economies of the street. There was a time that she believed in morality. She's seen too much since then. She will not let any of her family suffer like she did. In her mind allowing her children to be what she considers weak is not an option. The will prosper and she more than anyone knows only monsters prosper in this world. Her greatest fear is visiting the sins of her mother on her own children. She loved her mother dearly but that space in her heart has been overgrown with resentment for all the indignities that she lived through instead of the beautiful life her mother promised her.
*   **The Tragedy:** She would rather her children be monsters than victims.
*   **Prompt:** `Clara Rucastle, 50s, fading elegance, sharp eyes, wearing high-collar Victorian blouse, holding a bloody bandage, expression of twisted maternal affection, warm lighting.`

## Jephro Rucastle (The Father)
*   **Role:** The Banal Evil / The Scrubber.
*   **Psychology:** Selfish, greedy, and lacking self-awareness. He doesn't see himself as a slaver; he sees himself as a "Headhunter" or "Talent Scout." He compartmentalizes his cruelty as "just business." He lives to assert his power. He's entire life he has been rich surrounded by staff. He's a luddite, trying to cash in on the tech pirates while they're happy to throw money around. He knows ultimately money isn't power, power is power. He's developed his power, physically, through his network of eager illegal hands and by having no scruples with getting his hands dirty. Unknown to his high tech clients he belongs to a secret society with the aim of reverting technology 50 years. Technology is a crutch that has made men weak in his eyes. In truth the society is more like a 19th century gentlemen's club than an actual movement looking to effect change but it's members include some powerful people and that might yet change in the future.
*   **Prompt:** `Jephro Rucastle, male, 50s, heavy set, round face, jovial but sinister smile, sweaty skin texture, ill-fitting tweed suit, holding wine glass, warm fireplace lighting, uncanny valley aesthetic.`

## Beatrix Rucastle (The Legacy)
*   **Role:** The True Believer / The Nemesis.
*   **Psychology:** Raised in a house where human beings are inventory, she has no concept of empathy. She is the pure product of her parents' philosophy: A predator with no remorse.
*   **Prompt:** `Beatrix Rucastle, female, 19, pale skin, heavy dark cyber-goth makeup, neon green hair streaks, sneering expression, black leather and mesh clothing, holding high-tech dog whistle, harsh lighting.`

## Alice Rucastle (The Glitch)
*   **Role:** The Failed Prototype / "Neural Lace" Test Subject.
*   **Visuals:** Gaunt, hospital gown, shaved patch on head showing infected port.

# Arc 02 Cast: The Cobalt Cradle

## Simon Mercer (The Optimizer)
*   **Role:** Corporate Transhumanist / CEO of Aethelgard Biotics.
*   **Archetype:** Business Evil. Cruelty born of calculus, not malice.
*   **Visuals:** 40s, silver suit, rimless glasses, sterile and cold.
*   **Prompt:** `Simon Mercer, male, 40s, sleek silver suit, rimless glasses, cold expression, standing in sterile white laboratory, blue clinical lighting, holding tablet, hyper-realistic.`

## Leo Cassian (The Nurturer)
*   **Role:** Bio-Mechanic / The Sympathetic Ally.
*   **Dynamic:** The counterpoint to the series' toxic males. He represents durability through softness.
*   **Visuals:** 30s, messy hair, oil-stained coveralls, warm eyes.
*   **Prompt:** `Leo Cassian, male, 30s, kind eyes, weary expression, messy dark hair, wearing worn mechanic coveralls, holding a robotic hand gently, warm amber lighting, soft focus background.`

----------------------------------------
# Character Profile: Sylvia Vane (The "Watson")

## 1. Identity
*   **Role:** The Catalyst / The Avatar of Wrath.
*   **Status:** MIA (Presumed "Subject Zero").
*   **Archetype:** **The Manic Pixie Sword of Vengeance.**
*   **Relation to Corporate:** **None.** She is not an heiress or an insider. She was a **Commodity**.

## 2. The Narrative Function
Sylvia represents the **Catharsis of Violence**.
*   **The Dynamic:** Violet wants to solve the puzzle safely. Sylvia wants to burn the puzzle to the ground.
*   **The Voice:** Sylvia is the voice of every woman used, trafficked, and discarded by the system. She is the collective rage of the marginalized.
*   **The Interaction:**
    *   *Violet:* "If we trigger the alarm, the guards will come."
    *   *Sylvia:* "Good. Let them come. I want to see them bleed."

## 3. The Mystery
*   **The Disappearance:** Sylvia didn't vanish on a case. She was snatched off the street—randomly—just like the women Violet encounters.
*   **The Connection:** Violet’s discovery of "Subject Vane" in the Rucastle files is the inciting incident that proves Sylvia wasn't just "lost"—she was *consumed* by the machine Violet has just stumbled into.
*   **Prompt:** `Sylvia Vane, female, platinum blonde bob, piercing blue eyes, tuxedo jacket, semi-transparent edges, ethereal glow, cinematic rim lighting (blue/purple), chromatic aberration.`

----------------------------------------
# Character Profile: Violet Chase

## 1. Identity
*   **Role:** The Protagonist / The Accidental Detective.
*   **Age:** 28
*   **Occupation:** **Unemployed / Gig Worker.** (FORMERLY: Asset Recovery).
*   **Economic Status:** Destitute. The series begins with her hitting rock bottom.
*   **The Motivation:**
    1.  **Initial:** Survival. She takes the Rucastle job because she is starving, not because she is hunting.
    2.  **Evolved:** Justice/Vengeance. The horror she survives at Copper Beeches radicalizes her.

## 2. Psychology: The Intellectualization Defense
Violet is not a trained operative. She is a woman with a **trauma response that looks like superpowers.**
*   **The Broken Logic:** When the world feels chaotic or threatening, Violet dissociates. She stops feeling fear and starts seeing **Patterns**.
*   **The "Deduction" Mechanic:** It is not a cool gadget; it is a panic response. She counts heartbeats, calculates angles, and reads micro-expressions because if she can *quantify* the danger, she thinks she can control it.
*   **The Flaw:** Logic provides clarity, not comfort. She can deduce *how* a woman died, but she cannot process *why*.

## 3. The Visuals
*   **The "Civilian" Look:** She wears thrifted clothes, trench coats to hide her frame, and messy hair. She looks like someone trying to disappear, not someone trying to stand out.
*   **The Glitch:** When she is stressed, her POV (the panel art) becomes overlaid with obsessive data streams.
*   **Prompt:** `Violet Chase, female, 28 years old, chestnut hair, messy bun hairstyle, hazel eyes, heavy freckles on nose and cheeks, intelligent expression, sharp focus, natural skin texture, wearing fitted beige trench coat over navy turtleneck, noir lighting.`

# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum (Revised)

## 1. The Setup (The Desperation)
*   **The Status Quo:** Violet is broke. She isn't looking for a mystery; she is looking for rent money.
*   **The Hook:** The Rucastle job offers too much money for too little work. Violet takes it *despite* the red flags because she has no choice. This emphasizes the economic coercion of the trafficking world.

## 2. The Turning Point (The Realization)
*   **The Discovery:** Violet finds the "Wetware" lab not because she was snooping for evidence, but because she was trying to find a way out/escape the creepy Rucastles.
*   **The Link:** Amidst the horror of the lab, she finds a manifest or a data drive labeled **"Protocol: VANE."**
*   **The Shift:** This is the moment the genre shifts. It stops being a "Bad Job" story and becomes a "Personal Crusade." Violet realizes her missing friend is the *template* for this horror.
