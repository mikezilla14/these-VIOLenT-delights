# ViolENt Delights - Series Bible

**Status:** Active | **Genre:** Detective Mystery / Psychological Thriller / Noir
**Tagline:** "These Violet delights have violent ends."

## 1. High Concept
A freelance asset recovery specialist (Violet Chase) investigates a global trafficking network while haunted by the hallucination of her missing partner (Sylvia Vane). The series blends high-gloss erotica aesthetics with visceral horror and deductive logic.

## 2. The Core Loop
1.  **The Anomaly:** Violet identifies a node in the network.
2.  **The Infiltration:** Violet assumes a persona to enter the "Gilded Cage."
3.  **The Anchor:** Violet identifies the Arc's specific Victim/Ally.
4.  **The Descent:** Investigation deepens; "Sylvia" (Hallucination) becomes aggressive.
5.  **The Rupture:** Violent climax, rescue, and data extraction leading to the next node.

## 3. The 3 Hard Rules
1.  **The Deductive Absolute:** Violet solves problems through hyper-observation. No magic. Visuals: The world slows down, clues glow/outline.
2.  **The Arc Anchor:** Every arc mandates a unique Ally/Victim model to ground the story emotionally.
3.  **The Watson Variance:** "Sylvia" is an entity of ambiguous reality (ghost vs. psychosis). She interacts only with Violet.

## 4. Visual Style Guide
*   **Aesthetic:** *Light of My Life* (Ren'Py) meets *Cyberpunk Noir*.
*   **Key Elements:** Exaggerated/Idealized anatomy, high-contrast lighting, volumetric fog, "doll-like" textures broken by visceral emotion.
