# ViolENt Delights

**Current Version:** v2.3.0.0
**Status:** Active | **Genre:** Tech-Noir / Psychological Thriller / Bio-Horror
**Tagline:** "These Violet delights have violent ends."

## 1. High Concept
Violet Chase is not a detective; she is a desperate woman living on the poverty line of a proto-cyberpunk world. When she accepts a high-paying "aesthetic curation" job at a secluded estate to pay her rent, she stumbles into a global wetware trafficking network.

Guided—and goaded—by the hallucination of her missing friend **Sylvia**, Violet must transform her trauma-induced hyper-fixation on logic into a weapon. She isn't just solving a crime; she is uncovering the machine that consumed her friend.

## 2. The Core Loop
1.  **The Desperation:** Violet accepts a job/gig based on financial survival, ignoring red flags.
2.  **The Trap:** The job reveals itself to be a "Gilded Cage" (A clean room, a rig, a bunker).
3.  **The Glitch:** Violet’s stress triggers her "Deduction Mode"—a dissociation technique where she sees patterns to manage fear.
4.  **The Catalyst:** Sylvia (The Hallucination) urges Violet to stop analyzing and start destroying.
5.  **The Rupture:** A violent climax where Violet breaks the loop, saves the Arc's specific victim, and uncovers a piece of the "Vane Protocol."

## 3. The 3 Hard Rules (Narrative Axioms)

### I. The "Intellectualization" Defense
Violet’s deduction isn’t a superpower; it’s a panic response.
*   **The Rule:** When terrified, Violet doesn't scream. She counts. She calculates angles. She dissociates into logic.
*   **Visuals:** The world desaturates; probability percentages and wireframes overlay her vision.

### II. The "Manic Pixie Sword" (Sylvia)
Sylvia is not a passive ghost. She is the **Avatar of Wrath**.
*   **The Rule:** Violet wants to solve the puzzle safely. Sylvia wants to burn the puzzle to the ground. Sylvia represents the rage of every woman treated as a commodity by the system.
*   **Constraint:** Sylvia interacts only with Violet, acting as the reckless impulse Violet suppresses.

### III. The "Eden" Paradox (The World)
The setting (O.S.A.R.) is a "Preservation Zone" for the ultra-rich.
*   **The Rule:** The surface is Pastoral/Vintage (Tudor manors, forests, oceans), but the underbelly is High-Tech Rot (Wetware labs, Cyber-Mastiffs).
*   **Technology:** "Visible" cybernetics are illegal. The horror comes from "Invisible Tech" (Neural Laces, Genetic Tweaks) tested on disposable people.

## 4. Visual Style Guide
*   **Aesthetic:** *Crimson Peak* meets *Blade Runner*.
*   **Key Elements:** "Doll-like" idealized anatomy broken by visceral gore/emotion. High contrast between the "Organic/Warm" textures of Violet (Freckles, messy hair) and the "Synthetic/Cold" world (Chrome, Plastic, Neon).
