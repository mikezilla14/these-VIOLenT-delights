## SEQUENCE 1: THE HUNGER (Panels 1-7)
**Setting:** *The Midnight Diner (Sector 4 Border).*
**Atmosphere:** A sensory overload of cheap grease, rain, and failing neon.

**Panel 1 (Establishing - Vertical Scroll Start)**
*   **Visual:** Extreme Close-up on a window pane. Heavy, oily rain streaks down the glass. Through the distortion, we see the blurred, flickering neon sign of the diner.
*   **Narration Box (Violet):** "Hunger is a data point. It sharpens the senses."

**Panel 2 (Character Intro)**
*   **Visual:** Medium Shot. **VIOLET CHASE** in a booth. She wears a **fitted beige trench coat** (thrifted, worn seams) over a **navy turtleneck**. Her hair is a messy chestnut bun with loose strands.
*   **Visual Detail:** She is staring at a "Payment Declined" notification on a translucent chip. Her face is textured—freckles, pores, exhaustion. She looks *organic* in a plastic world.
*   **Narration Box (Violet):** "Desperation is noise. It drowns out the logic."

**Panel 3 (The Hallucination)**
*   **Visual:** **SYLVIA VANE** appears in the empty seat.
*   **Character Design:** She wears a **translucent plastic raincoat** (like a high-fashion body bag) over a **shredded silver sequin dress**. Her skin is pale. Where her heart should be, a **glowing gold/glitch fracture** radiates outward. Her eyes are solid cyan voids.
*   **Effect:** She is slightly translucent, with **chromatic aberration** (RGB split) on her edges.
*   **Sylvia:** "You’re vibrating, Vi. Low blood sugar? Or just the crushing weight of being a failure?"

**Panel 4 (The Glitch)**
*   **Visual:** Violet looks at a waitress passing by. The panel desaturates to **Wireframe Mode**.
*   **Overlay:** `[PULSE: 110] [PUPILS: DILATED] [OBJECTIVE: DEBT REPAYMENT]`
*   **Violet (Internal):** *She's skimming tips. High stress. Don't look. Don't count.*

**Panel 5 (The Offer)**
*   **Visual:** **JEPHRO RUCASTLE** (50s, Tweed Suit, Sweaty) slides a card onto the table. He looks like a colorized photo from the 1950s pasted into a cyberpunk scene.
*   **Rucastle:** "Miss Chase. I hear you locate things. I need you to locate your sense of adventure."

**Panel 6 (The Bribe)**
*   **Visual:** Rucastle slides a credit chip. The number **₡15,000** glows green against the grimy table.
*   **Rucastle:** "A performance role. My daughter needs a... companion. A mirror image."
*   **Sylvia (Leaning in):** Sylvia leans over Rucastle. Cyan pixels drip from her eyes like tears, floating upwards.
*   **Sylvia:** "He smells like copper and rot. Stab him with the fork. Take the wallet."

**Panel 7 (Acceptance)**
*   **Visual:** Violet ignores the ghost. She takes the chip. Her hand shakes slightly.
*   **Violet:** "When do I start?"

## SEQUENCE 2: THE ARRIVAL (Panels 8-12)
**Setting:** *Sector 4 - The Green Zone.*

**Panel 8 (The Transition)**
*   **Visual:** The car passes through the gates. The trees change from organic oak to **Metallic Copper Beeches**.
*   **Narration:** "Sector 4. Where the trees are antennas and the shadows cost money."

**Panel 9 (The House)**
*   **Visual:** The Rucastle Manor. A monstrosity of old Tudor wood and Brutalist concrete. Rain lashes the roof.

**Panel 10 (The Greeting - Clara)**
*   **Visual:** The front door opens. **CLARA RUCASTLE** (early 30s, High collar blouse, stern) stands there. She looks Violet up and down like she's buying a horse.
*   **Clara:** "She's too thin, Jephro. The dress will hang."
*   **Jephro:** "We'll feed her, Clara. We're not savages."

**Panel 11 (The Warning)**
*   **Visual:** Violet enters the foyer. It is warm, stuffed with taxidermy animals.
*   **Sylvia:** Sylvia is floating near a mounted deer head. She pokes its eye, her finger phasing through it with static.
*   **Sylvia:** "Look at the eyes, Vi. They aren't glass. They're cameras."

---

**Panel 12a (The Encounter)**
*   **Visual**: Violet is following Clara, but a hulking figure blocks the hallway. It is SILAS TOLLER. He is struggling to secure a heavy collar onto a CYBER-MASTIFF (not fully revealed yet, just claws and metal).
Sound SFX: CLANG. WHINE.
**Panel 12b (The Observation)**
*   **Visual**: Violet’s POV. Deduction Overlay activates.
Focus: Silas’s hands. They are shaking violently as he tries to thread a bolt.
Overlay: [TREMOR: 6Hz] [PUPILS: PINPOINT] [DIAGNOSIS: CHEMICAL WITHDRAWAL]
Violet (Internal): He’s not clumsy. He’s crashing. The security system is an addict.
**Panel 12c (The Dismissal)**
*   **Visual:** Clara snaps her fingers.
Clara: "Toller. Get the beast to the cellar. We have guests."
Silas: He glares at Violet, eyes bloodshot. A moment of unprompted hostility.
Silas: "Another doll for the collection? Don't wander at night, girl. The beast gets hungry."
*   **Panel 12d (The Clue)**
*   **Visual**: EUDORA TOLLER steps out of the shadows. She hands Silas a flask without a word. The dynamic is clear: she manages his addiction so he can manage the dog.
Violet (Internal): The wife enables the husband. The husband enables the dog. The dog protects the house. If I want to break the house, I break the chain.



## SEQUENCE 3: THE MAKEOVER (Panels 13-18)
**Setting:** *The Manor Bathroom.*
**Atmosphere:** Clinical, violating, cold.

**Panel 13 (Beatrix Intro)**
*   **Visual:** **BEATRIX RUCASTLE** (19, Cyber-Goth, Neon Green Hair) leans against a tiled wall, spinning iron shears on her finger. She looks bored but dangerous.
*   **Beatrix:** "Another stray? Father really is scraping the bottom of the barrel."

**Panel 14 (The Cut)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix roughly grabs Violet's hair.
*   **Violet:** "The contract said short. It didn't say bald."
*   **Beatrix:** "It said whatever I want it to say."
*   **Action:** *SNIP.*

**Panel 15 (The Assessment)**
*   **Visual:** Close up. Beatrix pauses, looking at Violet's reflection. Violet isn't crying; she's *calculating* the distance to the door.
*   **Beatrix:** "You're not high. The others are usually high by now."
*   **Violet:** "I like a clear head."

**Panel 16 (The Dress)**
*   **Visual:** Violet is shoved into the **Electric Blue Haptic Dress**. It hums with faint light.
*   **Visual Detail:** The dress contrasts sharply with Violet's freckled, textured skin.
*   **Sylvia:** "It fits like a body bag. I would know."

## SEQUENCE 4: THE DINNER (Panels 19-27)
**Setting:** *The Dining Room. Candlelight. Oppressive.*

**Panel 19 (The Table)**
*   **Visual:** Long shot of the table. Jephro at the head, eating a bloody steak with his hands. Clara eating daintily. Beatrix poking at food, glaring at a holographic tablet. Violet sits stiffly in the blue dress, plate untouched.

**Panel 20 (The Luddite)**
*   **Visual:** Jephro slams his hand down.
*   **Jephro:** "Put that digital filth away, Beatrix! We are eating!"
*   **Beatrix:** "I'm monitoring the perimeter sensors. Unless you want to patrol in the rain, Father?"

**Panel 21 (The Mother's Role)**
*   **Visual:** Clara places a hand on Jephro's arm. Calming the beast.
*   **Clara:** "She's just being thorough, dear. Like you taught her. Beatrix, put it away."

**Panel 22 (The Bully)**
*   **Visual:** Jephro sneers at Beatrix.
*   **Jephro:** "She hides behind screens because she's weak. The world is flesh and blood, girl. You have to get your hands dirty."

**Panel 23 (Violet's Intervention)**
*   **Visual:** Violet sees Beatrix gripping her steak knife too hard. **Trauma Logic** kicks in.
*   **Violet (Internal):** *Subject B is volatile. Subject A is ego-driven. De-escalate.*
*   **Violet:** "The sensors... they use RF triangulation? That's difficult to calibrate in a copper forest."

**Panel 24 (The Shift)**
*   **Visual:** Silence. Beatrix looks up at Violet, shocked. Jephro looks confused.
*   **Beatrix:** "Yes. The interference is... substantial."

**Panel 25 (De-escalation)**
*   **Visual:** Violet takes a bite of food, lowering her eyes. Submissive body language to soothe Jephro, but her words were for Beatrix.
*   **Violet:** "Mr. Rucastle is right. Technology fails. Instinct doesn't."

**Panel 26 (The Reaction)**
*   **Visual:** Jephro puffs up, ego stroked. Beatrix stares at Violet, realizing *exactly* what Violet just did.
*   **Jephro:** "Exactly! Listen to the stray, Beatrix."

**Panel 27 (The Look)**
*   **Visual:** Close up on Beatrix. A tiny smirk. Acknowledgment.

## SEQUENCE 5: THE FALSE ALLIANCE (Panels 28-36)
**Setting:** *The Balcony. Rain pouring outside.*

**Panel 28 (The Cigarette)**
*   **Visual:** Violet is outside (under an awning), shivering. Beatrix steps out.
*   **Beatrix:** "You played him. That was clean."

**Panel 29 (The Connection)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix offers Violet a sleek, black vape pen.
*   **Beatrix:** "You know tech? You don't look like a techie. You look like a street rat."
*   **Violet:** "I know how things work. It helps me know when they're about to break."

**Panel 30 (The Vulnerability)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix looks out at the dark trees.
*   **Beatrix:** "He thinks he runs this business. He's a dinosaur. If it wasn't for my algorithms, we'd have been raided years ago."

**Panel 31 (The Hope)**
*   **Visual:** Violet leans in. This is her chance.
*   **Violet:** "You could run it better? Without the... 'strays'?"
*   **Beatrix:** "I'd run it *efficiently*."

**Panel 32 (The Signal)**
*   **Visual:** Violet pulls out her dead phone.
*   **Violet:** "I just need to make one call. To tell my landlord I'm safe. Can you boost the signal?"

**Panel 33 (The Turn)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix looks at the phone, then at Violet. The "human" moment vanishes. The predator returns.
*   **Beatrix:** "Safe? You think you're safe?"

**Panel 34 (The Reality)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix leans close, her neon green hair glowing in the dark.
*   **Beatrix:** "We don't pay you to be safe, Violet. We pay you to be *mine*."
*   **Action:** Beatrix smacks the phone out of Violet's hand. It skitters into the rain.

**Panel 35 (The End)**
*   **Visual:** High angle shot. Violet standing alone on the balcony as Beatrix walks back inside.
*   **Visual:** Sylvia manifests next to Violet. Her chest wound is pulsing with jagged light.
*   **Sylvia:** "I told you, Vi. No friends. Only targets."

**Panel 36 (Black)**
*   **Text:** **ViolENt Delights**

## ARTIST NOTES & VISUAL GUIDELINES

1.  **Character Contrast:**
    *   **Violet:** Organic textures (skin pores, messy hair, wool, cotton). She feels warm but faded.
    *   **Sylvia:** Synthetic textures (plastic, sequins, digital artifacts). She feels cold and sharp.
    *   **Beatrix:** Hard textures (leather, metal, piercings).

2.  **Lighting Strategy:**
    *   **Diner:** High contrast Neon Cyan/Magenta.
    *   **Manor (Dinner):** Suffocating warm Tungsten (Orange/Brown).
    *   **Balcony:** Cold Blue/Black rain.

3.  **Sylvia's "Glitch" Effect:**
    *   Do not render her as a traditional "transparent ghost."
    *   She should look like an AR overlay that is malfunctioning.
    *   Use **Chromatic Aberration** and **Pixel Sorting** effects on her silhouette.
