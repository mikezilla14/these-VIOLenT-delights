## SEQUENCE 1: THE HUNGER (Panels 1-6)
**Setting:** *The Midnight Diner (Sector 4 Border).*
**Atmosphere:** A sensory overload of cheap grease, rain, and failing neon.

**Panel 1 (Establishing - Vertical Scroll Start)**
*   **Visual:** Extreme Close-up on a window pane. Heavy, oily rain streaks down the glass. Through the distortion, we see the blurred, flickering neon sign of the diner (Pink/Cyan).
*   **SFX:** *Tapping of rain. Hiss of steam.*
*   **Narration Box (Violet):** "Hunger is a data point. It sharpens the senses."

**Panel 2 (Transition)**
*   **Visual:** The camera pulls back through the glass. We see Violet’s reflection, but it's faint, ghostly.
*   **Narration Box:** "Desperation is noise. It drowns out the logic."

**Panel 3 (Character Intro)**
*   **Visual:** Medium Shot. **Violet Chase** sitting in a worn red leather booth. She looks exhausted. Her trench coat is damp. Her hair is in a messy, practical bun. She is staring at a cold cup of black coffee.
*   **Detail:** On the table, her hand rests near a translucent credit chip. The holographic display reads: **ERROR: INSUFFICIENT FUNDS [Balance: ₡4.32]**.
*   **Artist Note:** Emphasize the texture of her skin—freckles, shadows under eyes. She feels *real* in a plastic world.

**Panel 4 (The Hallucination)**
*   **Visual:** Violet sighs, closing her eyes.
*   **Visual:** When she opens them (Next beat), the empty seat opposite her is occupied.
*   **Character:** **SYLVIA VANE**. She is high-definition but slightly translucent at the edges. She wears a pristine tuxedo jacket and is smoking a cigarette. The smoke glows **electric blue** and defies physics, drifting *down* instead of up.
*   **Sylvia:** "You look like hell, Vi. And not the fun kind."

**Panel 5 (Dialogue)**
*   **Visual:** Violet takes a sip of the cold coffee. She doesn't look at Sylvia.
*   **Violet (Internal):** *I need a job. I need a ghost to shut up. I need a refill.*
*   **Sylvia:** "You need a miracle. Or a felony. I’m good with either."

**Panel 6 (The Waitress)**
*   **Visual:** A waitress walks past the booth. She looks tired, wearing a uniform with a cheap LED nametag that flickers.
*   **Violet's Eye:** We zoom into Violet's pupil. It contracts.

## SEQUENCE 2: THE DEDUCTION (Panels 7-11)
**Setting:** *The Diner.*
**Visual Gimmick:** **The Deduction Overlay**. The world turns Greyscale/Wireframe. Key details glow **Amber**.

**Panel 7 (POV - The Scan)**
*   **Visual:** POV Shot of the waitress.
*   **Overlay Graphics:**
    *   **Focus on Wrist:** *Text: [LIGATURE MARKS]* -> *Deduction: Debt Collector Grip.*
    *   **Focus on Pocket:** *Text: [BULGING OUTLINE]* -> *Deduction: Undeclared Cash Tips.*
    *   **Focus on Eyes:** *Text: [PUPIL DILATION 20%]* -> *Deduction: Low-grade Stimulants.*
*   **Narration Box:** "She's skimming tips to pay off a loan shark. She's high to keep the shift going."

**Panel 8 (Snap Back)**
*   **Visual:** Violet rubs her temples. The color slams back into the world (Jarring transition).
*   **Violet (Internal):** *Stop looking. You aren't getting paid to look.*

**Panel 9 (The Intruder)**
*   **Visual:** A heavy, meat-like hand slams a thick, cream-colored business card onto the table next to the coffee.
*   **SFX:** *THUD.*
*   **Card Text:** **THE COPPER BEECHES - PRIVATE CURATION.**

**Panel 10 (The Villain)**
*   **Visual:** Low angle looking up. **JEPHRO RUCASTLE**. He is large, imposing, and sweating. He wears a tweed suit that is too warm for the environment. He is smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes.
*   **Artist Note:** Contrast his "Analog/Retro" suit with the neon diner. He looks like he stepped out of 1950, but smells like ozone.
*   **Rucastle:** "Miss Chase? My sources tell me you locate lost things."

**Panel 11 (The Hook)**
*   **Visual:** Rucastle slides into the booth (Sylvia vanishes/glitches out of the way).
*   **Rucastle:** "I'm hoping you can locate your sense of adventure."

---

## SEQUENCE 3: THE PROPOSAL (Panels 12-18)
**Theme:** The Commodification.

**Panel 12 (The Pie)**
*   **Visual:** Rucastle is eating a synth-cherry pie. It’s messy. Red gel stains his lip.
*   **Rucastle:** "It's not security. It's... aesthetic curation. A live-in role."

**Panel 13 (Reaction)**
*   **Visual:** Violet looks skeptical, arms crossed.
*   **Violet:** "I don't do modeling, Mr. Rucastle. I find assets."
*   **Rucastle:** "Not modeling. **Performance.** I need you to sit in a room. Wear a dress. Read a book."

**Panel 14 (The Catch)**
*   **Visual:** Rucastle points a fork at her (menacingly casual).
*   **Rucastle:** "And cut your hair. Short. To the nape."

**Panel 15 (The Motivation)**
*   **Visual:** Close up on Rucastle’s sweaty face.
*   **Rucastle:** "My daughter... she misses her mother. You have her mother's build. Her bone structure. I pay **triple** your usual rate for the... theatrical inconvenience."

**Panel 16 (The Ghost's Vetting)**
*   **Visual:** Sylvia reappears, leaning over Rucastle’s shoulder like a predator. She is inspecting his neck.
*   **Sylvia:** "He's lying, Vi. His pulse is jumping visible in the jugular."
*   **Visual Detail:** Sylvia points to his wrist.
*   **Sylvia:** "But look at the watch. Patek Philippe. Real analog gold. That's six months' rent."

**Panel 17 (The Choice)**
*   **Visual:** Violet looks at the "Insufficient Funds" on her chip. Then at Rucastle.
*   **Sylvia (Whisper):** "Take the money. We've done worse for less."

**Panel 18 (Acceptance)**
*   **Visual:** Violet picks up the card.
*   **Violet:** "When do I start?"

## SEQUENCE 4: THE TRANSITION (Panels 19-22)
**Setting:** *Travel from Sector 1 (City) to Sector 4 (Forest).*

**Panel 19 (The Drive)**
*   **Visual:** Wide shot. Rucastle’s vintage luxury car driving away from the glowing city skyline. The road gets darker, the lights fewer.

**Panel 20 (The Trees)**
*   **Visual:** The car passes a gate. The headlights illuminate the **Copper Beeches**.
*   **Visual Detail:** The leaves aren't just purple; they are **metallic**. They reflect the light like polished bronze coins. The trunks look twisted and industrial.
*   **Narration Box:** "Sector 4. The Green Zone. Where the rich go to pretend the future didn't happen."

**Panel 21 (The Tech Drop)**
*   **Visual:** Violet checks her phone.
*   **UI Graphic:** Signal Bars dropping: 4... 2... 1... **NO SIGNAL**.
*   **Narration Box:** "Gen-Mod Copper Beeches. High metal content in the leaves. A natural Faraday cage."

**Panel 22 (The Foreshadowing)**
*   **Visual:** Violet looks up at the looming Manor House. In a high attic window, a small, gaunt silhouette (Alice) stands motionless.
*   **Violet:** "Who lives here besides you and your daughter?"
*   **Rucastle:** "Just us. And the dogs."

## SEQUENCE 5: THE MAKEOVER (Panels 23-32)
**Setting:** *The Manor Bathroom.*
**Atmosphere:** Clinical, violating, cold.

**Panel 23 (The Daughter)**
*   **Visual:** **BEATRIX RUCASTLE** (19). Heavy "Cyber-Goth" makeup, neon green streaks in black hair. She is chewing gum, looking bored. She holds heavy iron shears.
*   **Beatrix:** "This is the stray? She looks cheap."

**Panel 24 (The Command)**
*   **Visual:** Rucastle stands in the doorway. He holds a dress on a hanger—**Electric Blue Satin**. It glows faintly (Haptic Mesh).
*   **Rucastle:** "She is perfect. Beatrix, prepare the canvas."

**Panel 25 (The Chair)**
*   **Visual:** Violet sits on a stool in the center of the tiled room. Beatrix stands behind her. The reflection in the mirror shows Violet looking terrified.
*   **Beatrix:** "Don't move. Unless you want to lose an ear."

**Panel 26 (The Snip)**
*   **Visual:** Close up. The shears cut through the chestnut hair.
*   **SFX:** *SHHHK-CLIP.*
*   **Visual:** A long lock of hair falls past the "camera" (utilizing the vertical scroll speed lines).

**Panel 27 (The Commentary)**
*   **Visual:** Sylvia is sitting on the sink counter, swinging her legs. She watches the haircut.
*   **Sylvia:** "It exposes the neck, Vi. Makes it easier for the wolves to find the vein."

**Panel 28 (The Shave)**
*   **Visual:** Beatrix uses an electric razor on the back of Violet's neck.
*   **SFX:** *BZZZZZT.*
*   **Beatrix's POV:** We see Beatrix staring intently at Violet's exposed skin. She isn't looking at the hair; she is looking for a **Port Socket**.
*   **Beatrix:** "Clean skin. No ports. How quaint."

**Panel 29 (The Dress)**
*   **Visual:** Violet steps into the blue dress. It’s tight.
*   **Visual Detail:** As the fabric touches her skin, faint hexagonal honeycomb patterns light up on the fabric for a split second, then fade.
*   **Violet (Internal):** *It's warm. Like it's reading my pulse.*

**Panel 30 (The Reveal - Splash Panel)**
*   **Visual:** Full body shot of Violet. Hair cropped short in a sharp bob. Wearing the electric blue dress. She looks vulnerable, exposed, and strikingly beautiful in a haunted way.
*   **Mirror Reflection:** In the mirror behind her, **Sylvia** stands in her tuxedo, looking sad.
*   **Rucastle (Off Panel):** "Magnificent."

**Panel 31 (The Title)**
*   **Visual:** Close up on Violet's face. A tear/sweat drop rolls down past her freckles.
*   **Narration Box:** "These violent delights..."

**Panel 32 (Black Screen)**
*   **Text:** "...have violent ends."
*   **Graphic:** **ViolENt Delights** Logo (The 'N' flickers rapidly like a broken neon tube).

## ARTIST / PRODUCTION NOTES for AI GEN

1.  **Lighting Strategy:**
    *   **Diner Scenes:** High contrast Cyan/Magenta neon against deep blacks.
    *   **Manor Scenes:** Warm, suffocating Tungsten (Orange/Brown) for the wood, clashing with the harsh Clinical White of the bathroom.
    *   **The Dress:** The Blue Dress must pop. It should be the most saturated object in the scene, signaling "Anomaly."

2.  **Texture Priority:**
    *   **Violet:** Skin pores, freckles, stray hairs (Organic).
    *   **The World:** Chrome, plastic, polished wood, wet glass (Synthetic).

3.  **Sylvia's Ghost Effect:**
    *   Do not make her a "sheet ghost." She looks real, but her lighting is *wrong*. If the room is dark, she is lit by a spotlight. If the room is yellow, she is tinted blue. She has a subtle "Chromatic Aberration" (RGB split) on her edges.
