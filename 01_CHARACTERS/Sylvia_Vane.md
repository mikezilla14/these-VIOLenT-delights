# Character Profile: Sylvia Vane (The "Watson")



## 1. Identity* **Role:** The Catalyst / The Avatar of Wrath.* **Status:** Deceased **Archetype:** **The Manic Pixie Sword of Vengeance.*** **Spirit Reference:** *Onryō* / Modern *Yokai* (ala *Dandadan* or *Jujutsu Kaisen*). She is a medium for the pain of the discarded.

**The Random Victim**
Sylvia was simply a "statistically viable candidate" plucked from the street.
**The Horror**: Her tragedy is her insignificance to the villains. To the Rucastles, she was just "Batch 43." To Violet, she was the world.
**The Haunting**: She represents the cruelty of a system that consumes people and moves on. She refuses to fade away until the machine that ate her is broken.

## 2. Visuals: The "Glitch-Punk Haute Macabre" Aesthetic

Sylvia should look like she was designed by a high-fashion house that specializes in crime scenes. She is synthetic, jarring, and inherently digital in a mundane world. She represents the commodified body turned into a weapon.* **The Outfit:** A deconstructed, translucent plastic raincoat (think high-end fashion meets a body bag or vacuum sealing) worn over the shredded remains of a sequined party dress—the outfit she died in. It should look uncomfortable, plasticized, and crinkly.* **The "Jarring" Elements:**

* **The Wound:** A visible, stylized "Gold Kintsugi" crack or a digital glitch where her heart should be and radiates out across her body. It pulses when she gets angry.

* **The Eyes:** They don't reflect the environment. They are solid, glowing cyan or void black, often weeping "digital tears" (pixels dripping upwards).

* **The Contrast:** Violet is earthy/beige/textured. Sylvia is synthetic/neon/sharp. Violet looks like she smells like rain and old books; Sylvia looks like she tastes like ozone and blood.



## 3. The Narrative Function

Sylvia is not just a ghost; she is the **processor of trauma**.

* **The Medium:** When Violet encounters a victim (like Alice), Sylvia "absorbs" their pain. Her appearance shifts slightly to reflect the victim's suffering (e.g., if a victim was strangled, Sylvia might appear with a bruised neck for that scene).* **The Dynamic:** Violet tries to repress the horror (Intellectualize). Sylvia *becomes* the horror to force Violet to look at it.

* *Violet:* "The ledger says 40% casualty rate."

* *Sylvia (leaning in, eyes bleeding static):* "Don't call them casualties, Vi. Say their names. Scream them."



## 4. The Mystery* **The Connection:** Violet’s discovery of "Subject Vane" in the Rucastle files is the inciting incident. It proves Sylvia wasn't just "lost"—she was *consumed* by the machine.

* **The Tragedy:** The woman who was "too much life" for the world to handle was reduced to a static data point. Now, she refuses to move on until the machine is broken.
