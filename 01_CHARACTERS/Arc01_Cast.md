# Arc 01 Cast: The Rucastle Family

## The Family Dynamic: "Predator or Prey"
The Rucastles are not cartoon villains. They are a family unit warped by the belief that the world is a slaughterhouse, and they refuse to be the cattle.

## Clara Rucastle (The Mother)
*   **Role:** The Pragmatist / The Tiger Mother.
*   **Psychology:** She has seen the cruelty of the world (poverty, the corporate crush). She decided long ago that moral purity is a luxury she cannot afford.
*   **Motivation:** She loves her children absolutely. She enables Jephro’s "business" not because she enjoys it, but because it buys safety for her bloodline. Clara comes from a poor family and had to do everything she could to claw her way out of poverty. Jephro was her salvation from both poverty and the amoral economies of the street. There was a time that she believed in morality. She's seen too much since then. She will not let any of her family suffer like she did. In her mind allowing her children to be what she considers weak is not an option. The will prosper and she more than anyone knows only monsters prosper in this world. Her greatest fear is visiting the sins of her mother on her own children. She loved her mother dearly but that space in her heart has been overgrown with resentment for all the indignities that she lived through instead of the beautiful life her mother promised her.
*   **The Tragedy:** She would rather her children be monsters than victims.
*   **Prompt:** `Clara Rucastle, 50s, fading elegance, sharp eyes, wearing high-collar Victorian blouse, holding a bloody bandage, expression of twisted maternal affection, warm lighting.`

## Jephro Rucastle (The Father)
*   **Role:** The Banal Evil / The Scrubber.
*   **Psychology:** Selfish, greedy, and lacking self-awareness. He doesn't see himself as a slaver; he sees himself as a "Headhunter" or "Talent Scout." He compartmentalizes his cruelty as "just business." He lives to assert his power. He's entire life he has been rich surrounded by staff. He's a luddite, trying to cash in on the tech pirates while they're happy to throw money around. He knows ultimately money isn't power, power is power. He's developed his power, physically, through his network of eager illegal hands and by having no scruples with getting his hands dirty. Unknown to his high tech clients he belongs to a secret society with the aim of reverting technology 50 years. Technology is a crutch that has made men weak in his eyes. In truth the society is more like a 19th century gentlemen's club than an actual movement looking to effect change but it's members include some powerful people and that might yet change in the future.

## Beatrix Rucastle (The Legacy)
*   **Role:** The True Believer / The Nemesis.
*   **Psychology:** Raised in a house where human beings are inventory, she has no concept of empathy. She is the pure product of her parents' philosophy: A predator with no remorse.
