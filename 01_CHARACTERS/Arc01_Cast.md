# Arc 01 Cast: The Rucastle Family

## The Family Dynamic: "Predator or Prey"
The Rucastles are not cartoon villains. They are a family unit warped by the belief that the world is a slaughterhouse, and they refuse to be the cattle.

## Clara Rucastle (The Mother)
*   **Role:** The Pragmatist / The Tiger Mother.
*   **Psychology:** She has seen the cruelty of the world (poverty, the corporate crush). She decided long ago that moral purity is a luxury she cannot afford.
*   **Motivation:** She loves her children absolutely. She enables Jephro’s "business" not because she enjoys it, but because it buys safety for her bloodline.
*   **The Tragedy:** She would rather her children be monsters than victims.
*   **Key Scene:** She bandages a wound on Beatrix's hand (caused by Beatrix's own cruelty) with tender, loving care, whispering, "Be more careful next time, my love. Don't leave marks."

## Jephro Rucastle (The Father)
*   **Role:** The Banal Evil.
*   **Psychology:** Selfish, greedy, and lacking self-awareness. He doesn't see himself as a slaver; he sees himself as a "Headhunter" or "Talent Scout." He compartmentalizes his cruelty as "just business."
*   **The Flaw:** He assumes money can buy silence. He underestimates the rage of the "commodities" he sells.

## Beatrix Rucastle (The Legacy)
*   **Role:** The True Believer.
*   **Psychology:** Raised in a house where human beings are inventory, she has no concept of empathy. She is the pure product of her parents' philosophy: A predator with no remorse.
