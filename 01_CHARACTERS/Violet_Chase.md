# Character Profile: Violet Chase

## 1. Identity
*   **Role:** The Protagonist / The Accidental Detective.
*   **Archetype:** **The Drifter / The Wasted Potential.**
*   **Inspiration:** Julie (*The Worst Person in the World*) meets Sherlock Holmes.
*   **Age:** 28
*   **Occupation:** Gig Economy Nomad (Unemployed).
*   **Economic Status:** Destitute. She has burned through her safety nets.

## 2. The Backstory: "Jack of All Trades, Master of None"
Violet isn't a super-spy. She is a woman who couldn't pick a lane. This is the source of her "Skill Set."
*   **The Resume:** She did two semesters of Med School (knows anatomy/drugs) before quitting. She tried to be a Coder (knows basic hacking) but got bored. She worked in Logistics (knows shipping routes) and Photography (knows optics/observation).
*   **The Flaw:** She knows a little bit about everything, but she isn't an expert in anything. She is used to quitting when things get hard.
*   **The Stakes:** The Rucastle job is the first time she *cannot* quit, because the cost of quitting is death (hers or Alice's).

## 3. Psychology: The Intellectualization Defense
Violet is a woman with a **trauma response that looks like superpowers.**
*   **The "Spectator" Syndrome:** Violet often feels like a supporting character in her own life. She watches herself exist rather than feeling it.
Violet is not a psychic; she is a hyper-observer with no filter. Her "Broken Logic" is a trauma response that converts terror into data.

*   **The Trigger (Dissociation):** When the world feels chaotic or threatening, Violet involuntarily detaches. She stops feeling fear and starts seeing **Patterns**. This is not a superpower she summons; it is a survival mechanism she cannot turn off.
*   **The Burden of Sight:** The tragedy of Violet’s life is that she is always stressed because she is always looking. To an average person, a room is static and safe. To Violet, the room is screaming with hidden information—the micro-tremor in a hand, the scuff on a shoe, the lie in a smile. She sees through the superficial facade to the threatening truths people carry.

### The "Rolling Ball" Theory (How It Works)
Violet explains her ability simply: *"If you see a ball rolling toward the edge of a table, knowing it will fall isn't magic. It's just physics."*

*   **The Blind Spot:** Most people only see the ball. They miss the context.
*   **The Violet Sight:** Violet sees the **Cause** (the slight tilt of the table) and the **Kinetic Energy** (the speed of the roll).
*   **The Deduction:** Her "superpower" isn't predicting the future; it is perceiving the **Motion of the Present** with agonizing clarity. She accumulates the tiny, invisible data points that give "movement" to a static scene, allowing her to see the inevitable effect that everyone else misses.
    *   *Example:* She doesn't "guess" a man is violent. She sees the bruised knuckles (Data), the dilated pupils (Data), and the defensive posture of his wife (Data). The "Ball" is already rolling; she just knows where it lands.


*   **The Flaw:** Logic provides clarity, not comfort. She can deduce *how* a woman died, but she cannot process *why*.

## 4. The Motivation
1.  **Initial (Survival):** She takes the Rucastle job because she is starving and has exhausted the patience of every other employer in the city.
2.  **Evolved (Vengeance):** Finding the connection to Sylvia forces her to commit. Sylvia represents the one thing Violet didn't want to quit—and the guilt that she might have been "drifting" while Sylvia was dying is what radicalizes her.

## 5. The Visuals
*   **The "Civilian" Look:** She wears thrifted clothes that don't quite match—a remnant of her various "phases." Trench coats to hide her frame, messy hair that she constantly touches.
### Visualizing the Logic
*   **The Glitch:** When this state activates, the art style shifts. The chaotic noise of the panel fades. Key details—the rolling ball, the sweat bead, the loaded gun—are highlighted in sharp, clinical focus, often overlaid with "connective lines" showing the trajectory of her thought process.   
*   **Prompt:** `Violet Chase, female, 28 years old, chestnut hair, messy bun hairstyle with loose strands, hazel eyes, heavy freckles on nose and cheeks, intelligent but weary expression, sharp focus, natural skin texture, wearing fitted beige trench coat over navy turtleneck, noir lighting, cinematic depth of field.`
