# Character Profile: Violet Chase

## 1. Identity
*   **Role:** The Protagonist / The Accidental Detective.
*   **Age:** 28
*   **Occupation:** **Unemployed / Gig Worker.** (FORMERLY: Asset Recovery).
*   **Economic Status:** Destitute. The series begins with her hitting rock bottom.
*   **The Motivation:**
    1.  **Initial:** Survival. She takes the Rucastle job because she is starving, not because she is hunting.
    2.  **Evolved:** Justice/Vengeance. The horror she survives at Copper Beeches radicalizes her.

## 2. Psychology: The Intellectualization Defense
Violet is not a trained operative. She is a woman with a **trauma response that looks like superpowers.**
*   **The Broken Logic:** When the world feels chaotic or threatening, Violet dissociates. She stops feeling fear and starts seeing **Patterns**.
*   **The "Deduction" Mechanic:** It is not a cool gadget; it is a panic response. She counts heartbeats, calculates angles, and reads micro-expressions because if she can *quantify* the danger, she thinks she can control it.
*   **The Flaw:** Logic provides clarity, not comfort. She can deduce *how* a woman died, but she cannot process *why*.

## 3. The Visuals
*   **The "Civilian" Look:** She wears thrifted clothes, trench coats to hide her frame, and messy hair. She looks like someone trying to disappear, not someone trying to stand out.
*   **The Glitch:** When she is stressed, her POV (the panel art) becomes overlaid with obsessive data streams.
*   **Prompt:** `Violet Chase, female, 28 years old, chestnut hair, messy bun hairstyle, hazel eyes, heavy freckles on nose and cheeks, intelligent expression, sharp focus, natural skin texture, wearing fitted beige trench coat over navy turtleneck, noir lighting.`
