# Character Profile: Violet Chase

## 1. Identity
*   **Role:** The Protagonist / The Accidental Detective.
*   **Archetype:** **The Drifter / The Wasted Potential.**
*   **Inspiration:** Julie (*The Worst Person in the World*) meets Sherlock Holmes.
*   **Age:** 28
*   **Occupation:** Gig Economy Nomad (Unemployed).
*   **Economic Status:** Destitute. She has burned through her safety nets.

## 2. The Backstory: "Jack of All Trades, Master of None"
Violet isn't a super-spy. She is a woman who couldn't pick a lane. This is the source of her "Skill Set."
*   **The Resume:** She did two semesters of Med School (knows anatomy/drugs) before quitting. She tried to be a Coder (knows basic hacking) but got bored. She worked in Logistics (knows shipping routes) and Photography (knows optics/observation).
*   **The Flaw:** She knows a little bit about everything, but she isn't an expert in anything. She is used to quitting when things get hard.
*   **The Stakes:** The Rucastle job is the first time she *cannot* quit, because the cost of quitting is death (hers or Alice's).

## 3. Psychology: The Intellectualization Defense
Violet is a woman with a **trauma response that looks like superpowers.**
*   **The "Spectator" Syndrome:** Violet often feels like a supporting character in her own life. She watches herself exist rather than feeling it.
*   **The Broken Logic:** When the world feels chaotic or threatening, Violet dissociates. She stops feeling fear and starts seeing **Patterns**.
*   **The "Deduction" Mechanic:** It is not a cool gadget; it is a panic response. She lives below the surface of her trauma. She counts heartbeats, calculates angles, and reads micro-expressions because if she can *quantify* the danger, she thinks she can control it.
*   **The Flaw:** Logic provides clarity, not comfort. She can deduce *how* a woman died, but she cannot process *why*.

## 4. The Motivation
1.  **Initial (Survival):** She takes the Rucastle job because she is starving and has exhausted the patience of every other employer in the city.
2.  **Evolved (Vengeance):** Finding the connection to Sylvia forces her to commit. Sylvia represents the one thing Violet didn't want to quit—and the guilt that she might have been "drifting" while Sylvia was dying is what radicalizes her.

## 5. The Visuals
*   **The "Civilian" Look:** She wears thrifted clothes that don't quite match—a remnant of her various "phases." Trench coats to hide her frame, messy hair that she constantly touches.
*   **The Vibe:** Intelligent but scattered. Beautiful but exhausted. She looks like someone who is waiting for her life to actually start.
*   **The Glitch:** When she is stressed, her POV becomes overlaid with obsessive data streams—fragments of her abandoned degrees (medical terms, coding syntax) overlapping in a panic.
*   **Prompt:** `Violet Chase, female, 28 years old, chestnut hair, messy bun hairstyle with loose strands, hazel eyes, heavy freckles on nose and cheeks, intelligent but weary expression, sharp focus, natural skin texture, wearing fitted beige trench coat over navy turtleneck, noir lighting, cinematic depth of field.`
