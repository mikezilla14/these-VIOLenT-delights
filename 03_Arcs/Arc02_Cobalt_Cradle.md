# Arc 02: The Cobalt Cradle

## Synopsis
Violet infiltrates the *Aethelgard* Platform, a luxury rig in international waters. She uncovers a plot to create "Hollows"—cyborg workers stripped of emotions—and teams up with a compassionate mechanic, Leo, to incite a revolt.

## Key Plot Beats
1.  **The Infiltration:** Violet poses as a Concierge. Uses the "Mimic Compact" to steal Mercer's biometrics.
2.  **The Connection:** She finds Leo in the rust-filled maintenance levels, caring for the botched subjects.
3.  **The Horror:** The subjects die of "Broken Heart Syndrome" because they crave connection.
4.  **The Climax:** Leo releases the subjects. They "hug" Mercer to death in a desperate attempt to feel warmth.
5.  **The Lead:** The Governor Modules were shipped by "Vane Enterprises."

## Asset Prompts
*   **Location:** `Futuristic oil rig converted into luxury lab, middle of ocean, night, storm waves, glowing teal underwater lights, sleek white helipad.`
*   **The Pile:** `Group of cyborg test subjects huddled together on floor, wearing white hospital gowns, visible chrome ports on necks, shivering, tangled limbs, tragic composition.`
