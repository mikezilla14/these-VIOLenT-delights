# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum (Revised)

## 1. The Setup (The Desperation)
*   **The Status Quo:** Violet is broke. She isn't looking for a mystery; she is looking for rent money.
*   **The Hook:** The Rucastle job offers too much money for too little work. Violet takes it *despite* the red flags because she has no choice. This emphasizes the economic coercion of the trafficking world.

## 2. The Turning Point (The Realization)
*   **The Discovery:** Violet finds the "Wetware" lab not because she was snooping for evidence, but because she was trying to find a way out/escape the creepy Rucastles.
*   **The Link:** Amidst the horror of the lab, she finds a manifest or a data drive labeled **"Protocol: VANE."**
*   **The Shift:** This is the moment the genre shifts. It stops being a "Bad Job" story and becomes a "Personal Crusade." Violet realizes her missing friend is the *template* for this horror.

## 3. The Climax (Logic vs. Wrath)
*   **The Action:** Violet uses her **Logic** to hack the Cyber-Mastiff.
*   **The Emotion:** She uses **Sylvia's Wrath** to let the dog kill Jephro. She doesn't look away. This is her "Baptism" into the violent world.
