# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum (Revised)

## 1. The Setup (The Desperation)
*   **The Status Quo:** Violet is broke. She isn't looking for a mystery; she is looking for rent money.
*   **The Hook:** The Rucastle job offers too much money for too little work. Violet takes it *despite* the red flags because she has no choice. This emphasizes the economic coercion of the trafficking world.

## 2. The Turning Point (The Realization)
*   **The Discovery:** Violet finds the "Wetware" lab not because she was snooping for evidence, but because she was trying to find a way out/escape the creepy Rucastles.
*   **The Link:** Amidst the horror of the lab, she finds a manifest or a data drive labeled **"Protocol: VANE."**
*   **The Shift:** This is the moment the genre shifts. It stops being a "Bad Job" story and becomes a "Personal Crusade." Violet realizes her missing friend is the *template* for this horror.
# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum

## Synopsis
Destitute and desperate, Violet Chase accepts a high-paying job as an "Aesthetic Surrogate" at a secluded estate. She discovers the house is a "Clean Room" for scrubbing identities and testing illegal "Neural Lace" augmentations on human subjects.

## Key Plot Beats
1.  **The Desperation:** Violet accepts the Rucastle job to pay rent, ignoring the red flags (The Haircut, The Dress).
2.  **The Trap:** Violet realizes the glass room scans her biometrics for remote buyers. She is bait.
3.  **The Discovery:** She stumbles upon the "Wetware" lab. She finds **Protocol: VANE**, linking her missing friend to this horror.
4.  **The Climax:** Violet hacks the Cyber-Mastiff's IFF. Sylvia (The Hallucination) urges her to let the dog kill Jephro. Violet watches it happen.
5.  **The Aftermath:** Violet saves Alice (The Victim) but loses her innocence. She is now hunting Vane Enterprises.

## Asset Prompts
*   **Location:** `Wide angle shot of menacing estate, Tudor architecture mixed with Brutalist concrete, copper-colored metallic trees, heavy rain, ominous atmosphere.`
*   **The Mastiff:** `Large robotic mastiff, black carbon-fiber plating, exposed hydraulic muscles, glowing red sensors, drooling oil, rain dripping off metal.`
## 3. The Climax (Logic vs. Wrath)
*   **The Action:** Violet uses her **Logic** to hack the Cyber-Mastiff.
*   **The Emotion:** She uses **Sylvia's Wrath** to let the dog kill Jephro. She doesn't look away. This is her "Baptism" into the violent world.
