# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum (Revised)

## 1. The Setup (The Desperation)
*   **The Status Quo:** Violet is broke. She isn't looking for a mystery; she is looking for rent money.
*   **The Hook:** The Rucastle job offers too much money for too little work. Violet takes it *despite* the red flags because she has no choice. This emphasizes the economic coercion of the trafficking world.

## 2. The Turning Point (The Realization)
*   **The Discovery:** Violet finds the "Wetware" lab not because she was snooping for evidence, but because she was trying to find a way out/escape the creepy Rucastles.
*   **The Link:** Amidst the horror of the lab, she finds a manifest or a data drive labeled **"Protocol: VANE."**
*   **The Shift:** This is the moment the genre shifts. It stops being a "Bad Job" story and becomes a "Personal Crusade." Violet realizes her missing friend is the *template* for this horror.
# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum

## Synopsis
Destitute gig-worker Violet Chase accepts a suspicious, high-paying job as an "Aesthetic Surrogate" at the isolated Rucastle estate in the Green Zone. She enters a house at war with itself: a Luddite patriarch (Jephro), a pragmatist step-mother (Clara), and a usurper daughter (Beatrix).
To survive, Violet must navigate not only the toxic family dynamics but also the "Human Firewall"—the menacing staff, Silas and Eudora Toller, who guard the house's secrets with analog brutality.
The story is a Slow Burn Mystery. The reader acts as the detective alongside Violet, decoding the strange conditions of her employment (The Hair, The Dress, The Rules). As Violet uses her "Trauma Logic" to piece together the clues, she realizes she hasn't been hired as a companion, but as a "Wetware Chassis"—a replacement for the Thing in the Attic.

## Key Plot Beats

**The Hook (The Desperation)**:  Violet accepts the Rucastle job to pay rent. The high salary (₡15,000) acts as economic coercion, forcing her to ignore the red flags.
**The Makeover (The Violation)**: Violet is stripped of her identity. She meets Beatrix, who treats her with disdain but also curiosity.  Violet dons the Haptic Dress. She realizes she is wearing a piece of medical equipment disguised as couture. Beatrix is the one who cuts her hair, noting Violet's "calculating eyes" aren't like the usual drugged-up girls they hire. Violet meets Silas Toller (struggling with the Cyber-Mastiff) and Eudora Toller (holding the iron keys). She catalogs Silas’s withdrawal tremors—a weakness she can exploit later.

**The Dinner (The Dynamic)**: A tense family dinner establishes the hierarchy. Jephro bullies Beatrix for her obsession with technology. Clara enables the abuse to keep the peace. Violet utilizes her Trauma Logic to de-escalate Jephro, earning Beatrix's attention. Violet realizes Beatrix is also a prisoner, but one vying for the warden's keys.

**The Golden Cage (The Atmosphere)**
`The Routine`: Violet is paid to sit in specific rooms at specific times. She is essentially a "living prop."
`The Shadow`: Violet notices Eudora taking a tray of soft food/gruel to the barricaded attic wing.
`The Logic`: Jephro eats steak. Beatrix doesn't eat. Clara eats salads. Who is the mush for?
`The Family War`: Violet plays the family against each other. She sides with Beatrix’s tech-savvy arrogance to undermine Jephro’s analog authority, earning her a degree of freedom.


**The False Alliance**: Violet and Beatrix bond momentarily over a piece of tech (Jephro's jammer). Violet realizes Beatrix is also a prisoner of this house. Beatrix almost helps Violet send a message out, showing a crack in her armor.

**The Pivot (The Aha! Moment)**
The Catalyst: Silas Toller passes out drunk, leaving his keys exposed.
`The Discovery`: Violet uses the keys to breach the "Dead Zone" (Attic).
`The Twist`: She expects to find a monster. Instead, she finds Alice Rucastle.
Alice is gaunt, shaved, and fitted with a festering, rejected Neural Lace port.
`The Realization`: Alice isn't just sick; she is the failed prototype. Violet looks in the mirror and sees she has been styled to look exactly like Alice. Violet is the "Version 2.0" chassis.

**The Climax (The Choice)**:
Violet tries to smuggle Alice out. They are cornered by Jephro and the Cyber-Mastiff. Jephro orders Silas to release the dog, but Silas is incapacitated (Violet spiked his drink or he is simply comatose).
Jephro tries to control the dog himself using the analog whistle.
`Violet's Move`: She uses a recording of the whistle (captured earlier on her phone) to confuse the beast.
Beatrix's Choice: Beatrix watches. She could override the dog, but she chooses to let it turn on her father.

`Beatrix's Crucible`: Beatrix holds the "Kill Switch" for the dog. She sees her father being mauled.
`The Pivot`: Instead of saving him, she realizes this is her succession. She pockets the remote and watches him die.
Violet is horrified. `The Cost`: Jephro is mauled. Violet and Alice escape into the rain. Beatrix ascends the throne. Violet realizes she hasn't liberated a victim; she has crowned a new monster.


**The Aftermath (The Realization)**:
Violet escapes the estate, liberating Alice.
Violet visits Sylvia's estranged parents, looking for answers.
`The Twist`: In a box of Sylvia's "leftover things," Violet finds an Electric Blue Dress—identical to the one Rucastle made Violet wear.
`The Horror`: Sylvia wasn't "missing." She was a previous Rucastle surrogate. She died in that house. The haunting is no longer a question; it's a call to war.

## Asset Prompts
*   **Location:** `Wide angle shot of menacing estate, Tudor architecture mixed with Brutalist concrete, copper-colored metallic trees, heavy rain, ominous atmosphere.`
*   **The Mastiff:** `Large robotic mastiff, black carbon-fiber plating, exposed hydraulic muscles, glowing red sensors, drooling oil, rain dripping off metal.`
**The Dinner Table**: `Long mahogany table, candlelight reflecting on sweaty skin, Jephro eating voraciously, Beatrix sulking with a holographic tablet, Clara smiling tightly, Violet looking small in the blue dress.`
## 3. The Climax (Logic vs. Wrath)
*   **The Action:** Violet uses her **Logic** to hack the Cyber-Mastiff.
*   **The Emotion:** She uses **Sylvia's Wrath** to let the dog kill Jephro. She doesn't look away. This is her "Baptism" into the violent world.
