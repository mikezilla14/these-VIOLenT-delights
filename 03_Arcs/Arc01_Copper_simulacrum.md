# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum

## Synopsis
Violet accepts a job as a "Live-in Aesthetic Surrogate" at a secluded estate. She discovers the house is a "Clean Room" for scrubbing identities and testing illegal "Neural Lace" augmentations on human subjects.

## Key Plot Beats
1.  **The Hook:** Violet cuts her hair to expose her neck (Port-Ready aesthetic) and wears the Haptic Dress.
2.  **The Tech:** Violet realizes the glass room scans her biometrics for remote buyers.
3.  **The Discovery:** She finds Alice, who isn't insane, but suffering from a hardware rejection (The Glitch).
4.  **The Climax:** Violet hacks the Cyber-Mastiff's IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), causing it to maul Jephro.
5.  **The Lead:** Data points to "Subject Vane" being moved to **Marina Bay**.

## Asset Prompts
*   **Location:** `Wide angle shot of menacing estate, Tudor architecture mixed with Brutalist concrete, copper-colored metallic trees, heavy rain, ominous atmosphere.`
*   **The Mastiff:** `Large robotic mastiff, black carbon-fiber plating, exposed hydraulic muscles, glowing red sensors, drooling oil, rain dripping off metal.`
