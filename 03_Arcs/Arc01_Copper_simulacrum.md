# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum (Revised)

## 1. The Setup (The Desperation)
*   **The Status Quo:** Violet is broke. She isn't looking for a mystery; she is looking for rent money.
*   **The Hook:** The Rucastle job offers too much money for too little work. Violet takes it *despite* the red flags because she has no choice. This emphasizes the economic coercion of the trafficking world.

## 2. The Turning Point (The Realization)
*   **The Discovery:** Violet finds the "Wetware" lab not because she was snooping for evidence, but because she was trying to find a way out/escape the creepy Rucastles.
*   **The Link:** Amidst the horror of the lab, she finds a manifest or a data drive labeled **"Protocol: VANE."**
*   **The Shift:** This is the moment the genre shifts. It stops being a "Bad Job" story and becomes a "Personal Crusade." Violet realizes her missing friend is the *template* for this horror.
# Arc 01: The Copper Simulacrum

## Synopsis
Destitute gig-worker Violet Chase accepts a suspicious high-paying job as an "Aesthetic Surrogate" at the Rucastle estate. She enters a house at war with itself: a Luddite father, a pragmatist mother, and a daughter obsessed with the future. Violet must navigate their toxic family dynamics to survive, unaware she is being prepped as a test subject for illegal "Neural Lace" technology.

## Key Plot Beats

**The Hook (The Desperation)**: Violet accepts the job to avoid eviction. She ignores the red flags (isolation, NDA, physical surrender) for the paycheck.
**The Makeover (The Violation)**: Violet is stripped of her identity. She meets Beatrix, who treats her with disdain but also curiosity. Beatrix is the one who cuts her hair, noting Violet's "calculating eyes" aren't like the usual drugged-up girls they hire.
**The Dinner (The Dynamic)**: A tense family dinner establishes the hierarchy. Jephro bullies Beatrix for her obsession with technology. Clara enables the abuse to keep the peace. Violet utilizes her Trauma Logic to de-escalate Jephro, earning a moment of grudging respect from Beatrix.
**The False Alliance**: Violet and Beatrix bond momentarily over a piece of tech (Jephro's jammer). Violet realizes Beatrix is also a prisoner of this house. Beatrix almost helps Violet send a message out, showing a crack in her armor.
**The Discovery**: Violet finds Protocol: VANE in the wetware lab. She realizes the "Surrogates" aren't models; they are chassis.
**The Climax (The Choice)**:
Violet hacks the Cyber-Mastiff to attack Jephro during a violent confrontation.
`Beatrix's Crucible`: Beatrix holds the "Kill Switch" for the dog. She sees her father being mauled.
The Pivot: Instead of saving him, she realizes this is her succession. She pockets the remote and watches him die.
Violet is horrified. She realizes she hasn't liberated a victim; she has crowned a new monster.
**The Escape**: Violet rescues Alice and flees, leaving Beatrix as the new head of the Rucastle criminal empire.

## Asset Prompts
*   **Location:** `Wide angle shot of menacing estate, Tudor architecture mixed with Brutalist concrete, copper-colored metallic trees, heavy rain, ominous atmosphere.`
*   **The Mastiff:** `Large robotic mastiff, black carbon-fiber plating, exposed hydraulic muscles, glowing red sensors, drooling oil, rain dripping off metal.`
**The Dinner Table**: `Long mahogany table, candlelight reflecting on sweaty skin, Jephro eating voraciously, Beatrix sulking with a holographic tablet, Clara smiling tightly, Violet looking small in the blue dress.`
## 3. The Climax (Logic vs. Wrath)
*   **The Action:** Violet uses her **Logic** to hack the Cyber-Mastiff.
*   **The Emotion:** She uses **Sylvia's Wrath** to let the dog kill Jephro. She doesn't look away. This is her "Baptism" into the violent world.
